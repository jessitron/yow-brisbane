# Adventures in Elm, at [YOW! Brisbane 2016](http://brisbane.yowconference.com.au)

The app in this repository lets you add labels to a diagram of the Elm Architecture. [Try it now!](http://jessitron.github.io/yow-brisbane) Click and then type to make a label; press Enter to save it. Check out the Elm debug tool in the bottom-right of the window! It shows all the messages received by the Elm app, and the current contents of the model (application state). Click on an earlier message to see how the screen looked just after it was received, and the contents of the model at that time. Export the messages, refresh the app, and then import that file to see the state rebuilt!

The application in this repository was built during the talk, using the following tools:

* The [Elm Language](https://elm-lang.org), which includes a compiler (`elm make`) and a package manager, by [Evan Czaplicki](https://github.com/evancz).
* For text editing, the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor by GitHub
* The [language-elm](https://atom.io/packages/language-elm) atom package for Elm syntax highlighting, by [Eric West](https://github.com/edubkendo)
* For code formatting, [elm format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) and its [atom package](https://atom.io/packages/elm-format) by [Aaron VonderHaar](https://github.com/avh4)
* For selecting among paste buffers, [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
* Keynote. The slides are [here](yow-brisbane.pdf) in case you want them, but they're not meant to be informative on their own.
* [Rug](https://github.com/atomist/rug-cli) code-modification runtime and libraries, by [Atomist](https://atomist.com), with my [Elm editors](https://github.com/jessitron/elm-rugs).
